## Why

Why did we build Crosscheck Sports? It was born out of a need. With experience running adult league hockey teams and trying to figure out who wants to play in what season, and who is substituting on certain games, or even trying to find a goalie for a late night game, it became very clear that a robust roster management system needed to exist for teams to lean on. So while developing this sports team roster management system, all of the stored data about the team could be used to present a polished product to an end user. So, with two main features for users in checking into events and a chat system, this tool gives team owners the ability to manage their complex roster cases in an easy to use format while also giving their users access to a hub for all of the information about the team and season they are a part of to live. We hope you enjoy using this app as much as we enjoyed making it.
